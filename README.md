# Kick-Detection-and-pose-estimation
This project is used to detect and count number of kicks in a sample video. It uses Mediapipe for Pose detection and drawing the landmarks over it, it also uses Yolov3 to tackle a problem of multiple person detection which occurs with Mediapipe. A Machine learning model is trained on a dataset for "Kicking" and "Standing" and uses it for detection.
